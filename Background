The Unbearable Lightness of Being is a 1984 novel by Milan Kundera, about two women, two men, a dog and their lives in the 1968 Prague Spring period of Czechoslovak history.
Although written in 1982, the novel was not published until two years later, in a French translation (as L'Insoutenable légèreté de l'être). 
The Unbearable Lightness of Being takes place mainly in Prague in the late 1960s and early 1970s. 
It explores the artistic and intellectual life of Czech society from the Prague Spring of 1968 to the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union and three other Warsaw Pact countries and its aftermath.
Approximately 500,000 Warsaw Pact troops attacked Czechoslovakia that night, with Romania and Albania refusing to participate.
East German forces, except for a small number of specialists, did not participate in the invasion because they were ordered from Moscow not to cross the Czechoslovak border just hours before the invasion.
137 Czechoslovakian civilians were killed and 500 seriously wounded during the occupation.
